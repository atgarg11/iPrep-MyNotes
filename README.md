    dirty, there is probably another alternative / Trick to it. 
### Reduce a minimum problem to a maximum problem and vice versa.
* [LC1658 Minimum Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-reduce-x-to-zeroo)
    
    This problem is easily reduced to a maximum subarray sum problem, which is much more
        easier and manageable to solve.
